# Very Basic x86 OS

A few very simple OS programs that can run on a x86 CPU.

## List of Binaries

* `simple_boot`
	* A simple boot section that only runs in a loop, probably the minimal valid OS
* `hello_boot`
	* A simple boot section that prints "Hello" and then loops
* `printer_boot`
	* A slightly more complex boot section that prints multiple strings of characters
